Multiple Postal communities are linked to multiple political communities and vice versa. 

The zip and zip addition are the compound key for a postal community.

The short name and long name of the Political communities are the exact same in the GDE csv.

Many different postal communities share the same name, including Lausanne, who is, surprisingly, in the political community Lausanne. But only 10% of this Lausanne is in Lausanne.

Unless “%_IN_GDE” means something else, some political communities must slightly overlap. In the case of Bercher, it is 100% in Bercher but also 0.76% in Boulens and 0.21% Montanaire

The numbering of political communities has gaps. Eg there is no political district 15. This may also be a relic of the history of Switzerland as political communities change and merge, change district, or canton etc. as borders change internally.
